!!! Warning
    Pyaket will be installable again from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/pyaket) in the future, but not until a few blockers are resolved:

    - [ ] Astral-sh must publish [uv](https://crates.io/crates/uv) and all its [subcrates](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/tree/main/crates) to the registry, as git deps are not allowed
    - [x] Setup trusted publishing for better security and reliability

    Otherwise, the recommended instalation methods are via PyPI.
