## Open Source Sustainability

> _Many developers struggle with resources to maintain, improve or develop their projects._

Pyaket truly believes Open Source developers are entitled to be rewarded for their hard work, per gained trust and value they provide to the community.

Python _fundamentally lacks_ a way to easily distribute portable executables that "just work" across platforms, leading to frustrating experiences and spaghetti installation instructions for users. This is no different than compiled languages, only but making python a first-class citizen too.

By leveraging easy to use, fast one click portable executables, it achieves:

- **Lower entry barriers** making your project accessible to a wider audience.
- **Simpler documentation**, as power-users already knows what to do.
- **Reliable installations**, reducing user errors and support requests.
- And others;

Essentially, you're selling convenience while simplifying your work.
