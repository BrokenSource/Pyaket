## Usage

### Open Source

Pyaket is free to use for any project under [Open Source Initiative Approved Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses) that shares fully featured releases at no cost (Free Projects). Similar to compilers and other tools, it does not require your project to also be AGPLv3 licensed to use it, except for changes to pyaket itself.

- No strings attached, we're both Free and Open Source Software for the cause!
- Share the word by linking or attributing the project if it helped you out 🚀

!!! tip "Pyaket encourages selling Open Source Software"
    Read about its [Mission](./mission.md) on sustainability, you _deserve_ to be rewarded for your work!

### Commercial

Commercial use, including, but not limited to, selling executables, for-profit deployments, bundling proprietary software, internal use without distribution requires a [Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/Tremeschin) tier. You may freely evaluate the viability beforehand, or use it to get started[^get-started] under a limited budget or uncertainty.

[^get-started]: Using the future revenue made by your project to sponsor is perfectly fine!

- Feel free to [Get in Touch](./contact.md) for custom agreements, questions, discounts, grants, features you'd need to make it work for you, or anything else really, the customer is always right!

### Educational

No restrictions, as in teaching, research, academic projects or deployments, and alike.

## Code

The code is licensed under the [AGPLv3](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-agpl-3-0) terms - a strong copyleft license to ensure it remains forever **Free and Open Source** for all users. You may [Get in Touch](./contact.md) for a custom agreement to lift restrictions of the license to extend it privately, if your use case requires so.

### Contributions

Following a [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) model, by submitting any contributions to the project, you agree to transfer all rights of your submissions to the project authors, including permission to incorporate and use them as part of the project under any applicable licenses.

Pyaket will move to a permissive license in the future, otherwise it would be hard to migrate.

## Liability

Pyaket is **not** responsible for, and cannot be held liable for any violations related to developer-specified dependencies, externally bundled assets, or damages caused by its use.
