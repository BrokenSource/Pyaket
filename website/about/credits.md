Pyaket wouldn't be possible without an uncountable number of open-source libraries.

## Main integrations

### [Astral-sh](https://astral.sh/)

Creators of the almighty [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) that revolutionized the python ecosystem, and other amazing tools like [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and [`ty`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty), it powers Pyaket's fast and reliable python, package and project management.

- Literally the backbone of the project, pushes reliability and performance to the limits.

### [Cargo Zigbuild](https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-zigbuild)

Facilitates wonders of cross-compilation using [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) as a linker. Supporting multiple platforms and archs was never so easy in a mostly pure-rust project without running the target hosts natively.

### [Zensical](https://zensical.org/)

Beautiful markdown documentation site generator that you are reading right now!
