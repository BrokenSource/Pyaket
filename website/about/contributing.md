Hi, and thanks for your interest in contributing to the project!

## Pull requests

Generally speaking, I am not accepting (features) pull requests at the moment, as the project is still young and rapidly evolving, with many plans on its [roadmap](./roadmap.md). Coding time is not a bottleneck, but rather design, implementation, and reliability's thinking time - all of which we can [discuss](./contact.md) together!

However, smaller contributions such as bug fixes, new or missing examples, Docker and Workflow improvements are welcome. Typos are not worth a pull request, just message me instead.

Note that all contributions are subject to the project's [license](./license.md).

## Documentation

My focus is always on the code's engineering, structure and developer experience.

While everything is written and organized in a way that looks _"readable"_ to me, not everyone may find it intuitive or have the expertise to navigate it, which is where good documentation comes in.

Any help with better examples, wording, structure are greatly appreciated!
