<!-- Todo: Free to use for OSS projects and testing/developing, but not for commercial or private use -->

## Commercial use

Pyaket is free to use for open source projects that distributes releases at no cost.

Commercial usage (including selling executables, for-profit deployments) or bundling proprietary software requires an appropriate [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/Tremeschin). You may freely evaluate the viability beforehand, or use it to get started at a limited budget. Help me become a full-time open source developer!

Get in touch if you have any questions, need support or features, or want a custom agreement.
